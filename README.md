Basic Pacman (without ghosts) implemented with pygame with addition of search algorithms that automate the process of finding food. It is possible to play without automation.

TODO:
- add more search algorithms
- add ghosts and algorithms to solve this problem
- add menu
- add new methods to measure and visualize algorithms
- add test cases
